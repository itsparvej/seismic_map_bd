"Mapping Bangladesh's Seismic Risks: 2001-2025 Earthquake Patterns Revealed" 
Using USGS earthquake data, I created a seismic risk map of Bangladesh, classifying zones from very low to very high risk. This helps visualize earthquake vulnerability for disaster preparedness and urban planning. A critical tool for policymakers, researchers, and communities! 
What It Shows: 
‚Ä¢	Data Span: Earthquake occurrences from 2001‚Äì2025 (magnitude, location). 
‚Ä¢	Risk Zones: 5-tier classification (very low to very high ) based on interpolated seismic activity. 

How to Make One for Yourself: 
1.	Data Collection: 
‚Ä¢	Download earthquake data (2001‚Äì2025) from USGS Earthquake Catalog . 
‚Ä¢	For download Bangladesh data, use Geographic region as custom and give the North, South, East, West location in the box.
‚Ä¢	Then download the data in csv format.

 
2.	Shapefile Prep: 
‚Ä¢	Get Bangladesh‚Äôs administrative boundary shapefile from GADM or DIVA-GIS or Hum data website. 
‚Ä¢	Then add the csv to ArcGIS and show it as xy table to point, select the magnitude field as Z field and longitude as x, latitude as x.
‚Ä¢	Then export this feature as shapefile.
‚Ä¢	Then clip the earthquake shapefile based on BD administrative boundary.
 
3.	Interpolation in ArcGIS Pro: 
‚Ä¢	Use Kernel Density or IDW tools to map seismic intensity. 
‚Ä¢	For IDW spatial analyst tool, select the earthquake shapefile as input point featur , select magnitude field as Z field value, give a output name and location and in Environments tab select coordinate system as wgs1984, select the Extent and Mask in Raster Analysis as bd shapefile.
 
4.	Risk Classification: 
‚Ä¢	Reclassify the interpolated raster into 5 zones using Equal Interval or Natural Breaks from the symbology pan of the IDW.
‚Ä¢	Then change the color as you like 
5.	Design & Export: 
‚Ä¢	Add legends, scale bars, and labels. Use color ramps (e.g., green ‚Üí red) for clarity. 
‚Ä¢	Export as PDF/high-res image for sharing.
